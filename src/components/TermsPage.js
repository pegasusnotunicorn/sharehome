            Love, Career & Magic is a passion project—just me, an indie game
            dev, bringing this game to life. When you buy from me, you agree to
            the following:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Your information is only used to process and ship your order.
            </li>
            <li>
              All sales are final unless your order arrives damaged or something
              goes missing.
            </li>
            <li>
              If anything goes wrong with your order,{" "}
              <a href="/contact">reach out</a> and I'll do my best to fix it!
              Just keep in mind, I’m a one-person team, so it might take a
              little time to get back to you.

            Big game studios can throw millions at advertising—I can’t. I just
            want my game to be played by the people who will{" "}
            <strong>actually</strong> love it.
          </p>
          <p>
            To do that, I use cookies and data to help figure out where to find
            those players. I don't store or sell any of your personal data. I
            just use it to connect with the right audience.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              I only collect the bare minimum information needed to process and
              ship your order.
            </li>
            <li>
              I also add your email address to my mailing list, so I can send
              you updates about the game. You can unsubscribe at any time.
            </li>
            <li>
              I don’t sell, share, or store your data beyond what’s necessary
